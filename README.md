# PatternLock
### Users can set passwords using images and a particular sequence using this project, which implements the same concept for password authentication as recapcha (checks for human).
### In this method, the user is required to select some images in a specific pattern, next time the user tries to log  in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was  used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it
### Dictionary attacks and brute force search are infeasible.
